%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% DETAILED COMMENTS:

% from Ed Waddington

%  Set up initial (steady-state) condition S_0(x) for ice-surface height.
%  Routine uses a 2-step algorithm that is consistent with numerical
%  scheme, in the sense that it should produce a surface profile that will
%  be steady in the numerical scheme with the specified mesh.
%
%  Surface elevation must be specified at one point.
%  Boundary condition S_0_in is applied at "upstream" (left) boundary,
%  x_w(1), which is a flux point rather than a thickness point.
%
%  When thickness is known at a flux point x_w(i), we can calculate the
%  slope there and project to find surface S_0(i) at next "downstream"
%  thickness point x_P(i).  (This linearity between thickness points is
%  assumed assumption in numerical model.)
%
%  Then we need to find thickness S_e(i) at next "downstream" control-volume
%  edge x_e(i) such that the slope there, when projected back, exactly
%  reproduces S_0(i) at x_P(i), which again is the assumption of linearity
%  between thickness points in the numerical scheme.
%  Routine uses Newton's method to find best S_e(i). 
%
%
%
%   In this first simple steady-state model, we use Shallow Ice
%   Approximation to integrate dS/dx with flux derived kinematically 
%   from accumulation b_dot(x,t) and width W(x)
%
%   This routine could be generalized so that thickness could be
%   specified at any x, rather than always at "upstream" boundary x_w(1).
%   But not to bother now.
